Outline of bulkemailer code files. See README.md for a project description.

bulkemailer/main.py

1. start() Starts GUI. Features windows to edit config.xml file. In toolbar, buttons [download, about]. 
2. process() Meant to be run in a xterm window by clicking a desktop shortcut.

Module which interacts with the config xml file.

bulkemailer/egg.py
Module for interacting with Python egg file. (File) resources are taken from the egg.
